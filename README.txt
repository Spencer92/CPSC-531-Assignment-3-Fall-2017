This was compiled using eclipse, it should be able to be
compiled using any other method of compiling java.

In order to run the program, there's two wars

If nothing is submitted, it will run through a predetermined
set of values.

To set your own values, the method to submit them is

mu1 mu2 lambda chairs

where 	mu1 is a double
	mu2 is a double
	lambda is a double
	chairs is a int

If you only want one barber, set mu2 to 0.0

If running the predetermined values, it will repeat some
already done values, but those values are the same, and as
such should not affect anything important
